# CCH

CCH is a C compiler written in Haskell. It is a toy project that I am using to explore how compilers work and further my understanding of C, Haskell, and ultimately whatever I target the compiler to. The current plan is to have the compiler output either x86 assembly or LLVM IR. I will make a decision after completing some of the core parts of the compiler.
